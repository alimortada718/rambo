            Now is the best time to engage in civic engagement especially 
            voting with parliamentary elections coming in less than a year. 
            Its time to bring an effective and competent leadership in Lebanon 
            and the only way to do that is by voting in the upcoming elections.
            <br>
            <br>
            Voting is a very important part of any democracy. By voting,
            citizens are participating in the democratic process. Citizens vote for 
            leaders to represent them and their ideas, and the leaders support the citizens' interests. 
            It is a way to get their voices heard.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lebanon is country that has been through 
            countless wars both internal and external. But the 
            biggest problem it faces is within specifically its elite
            corrupt political class. The people in power have
            been in power for decades and some of them have given their sons their reigns of power
             These corrupt sectarian leaders have led the country to the brink of collapse
             On October 17 we saw millions take to the streets demanding the resignation of the President
            and the government and calling for early parliamentary elections.
            <br>
            <br>
            Below are some of the reasons to vote in the upcoming elections.
            To start Lebanon is currently facing an economic crisis similar to that of Venezuela with the Lebanese Lira losing more than 90%
            of its value
           <br>
           <br>
            Second, Lebanon is facing the aftermath of an explosion in the Beirut port that is one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions in history
            that left 200 dead, thousands injured and at least 150,000 homeless all because of neglect and carelessness of explosions.
           <br>
           <br>
            Third Lebanon is facing deep sectarian divisions among the population that were created by the Corrupt political elite in order to keep 
            population under control. This as created hatred among the Lebanese population rather than unity.
           <br>
           <br>
            Fourth, Lebanon is facing huge levels of corruption using clientelism. This method has helped them get elected and stay in power for so long. It is most common during the election period.
           <br>
           <br>
            Fifth, Lebanon is facing power cuts that occur at least 8 hours a day sometimes longer.
            Along with the lack of water at home. People are obliged to buy water for their homes and obliging people who need electricity 
            to buy amperes from a local politically affiliated person in their neighborhood in order to have electricity at homes

           <br>
    
          1. Go to the Electoral Lists page on the DGCS website,
            <a href="https://www.dgcs.gov.lb/404?aspxerrorpath=/arabic/voters-list">
                here
            </a> 
            <br>
            <br>
            2.Select the required details using the drop-down lists (governorate, district, 
            village/neighborhood, gender, sect, and civil registry number). These details can 
            be found on your identification documents (national ID or passport).
            <br>
            <br>

            3.Click Search.
            <br>
            <br>
            4.Search for your name in the resulting list. If it is there, 
            you are eligible to vote. Make sure to check the details for any errors or misspellings.

            (0000xxxxxxxx) in the dedicated field and click Search 
            to view your details individually, instead of searching through your localityâ€™s list.
            <br>
            <br>
            In case you find a mistake, you can report it to the 
            DGCS by downloading and filling a correction-request form, then 
            submitting it to your civil registration office, or to the Lebanese embassy or consulate if you live abroad.
